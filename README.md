# hello-world
First Github Entry

Hello,

This is where I want my future projects to end up on. This is a centralized location, off-site and off my main computer network, allowing for less clutter. Over time I expect to get better at programming and my work will eventually be put up here. Some of my interests are flexible industry and public policy. Thinking of ideas and creating models of those ideas is something I do in my free time, but creating a dynamic model of how humans interact with decision making on an industrial scale is something I would like to be able to do and presenting my work here would seem like a good start. 


End? End.
